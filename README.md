# First iteration of the library project from The Odin Project javascript route curriculum
This project was my first real attempt at working with broader transiton animations - trying to give visual indicators for actions across the page,
and also included my first color scheme. Design principles as of now have not been implemented. As this project was to gain familarity with prototypes, 
I will revist this project to better use prototypes, add a simple backend, and refactor with proper design princples.
